                To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, processing, copying, modification, disposal, loss, misuse, modification or similar risks during the course of your use of our Platform and/or Services, we have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures such as:
                (a) Restricting access to personal data to individuals who require access;
                (b) Maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access;
                (c) Using 2048-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption technology when processing your financial details; and/or

                You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures. You are also advised to exercise caution with respect to the sharing of your personal data and your authentication/ security details (such as passwords, credit card details, transaction details) outside of our Platform / Services.

                The Platform may contain links to other websites operated by other parties, such as our business affiliates or payment gateways.
                We are not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by these other parties.
                You are advised to check on the applicable privacy policies of those websites to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.
                Please note that even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these third party websites, each of which may have their own separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us.
                We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, security arrangements (or lack thereof) and activities of these linked sites.
                These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.
                Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Platform and the links placed upon each of them and therefore welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including, without limitation, if a specific link does not work).
