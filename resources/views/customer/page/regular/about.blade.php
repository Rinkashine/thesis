                <div class="indent-5"> Roman Dental Supplies Trading is a company launched in 2009 owned by Par, Roldan Vargas.
                    The company is located at Grand Royale Subdivision, Barangay. Pinagbakahan, City of Malolos,
                    Bulacan. The company is an importer and distributor of dental supplies and equipment.
                    The company offers business transactions from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday to Saturday.</div>
                <div class="indent-5 mt-2">
                The company has one employee, the owner, only himself, who covers all the services of the business. The owner handles the inventory, sales, billing, delivery, and inquiries.
                Customers can reach the company through phone calls or SMS to inquire and make orders. After the customer makes an order, the owner then creates order details, providing the customerâ€™s name, order date, names of products, the quantity of products, and its subtotal.
                For payment, the company accepts cash on delivery, and Gcash. Which are received and processed by the owner.
                Customers have options to acquire their orders, either through delivery, pick up or meet-up. There are no delivery fees if the order is made within the area coverage. On the other hand, the customer will have delivery fees if the product is delivered by a third-party delivering service like JNT.
                The company does not have a list of its customers' information such as its addresses. Customers can request a replacement or refund within a week if the item has not been opened and in not good condition, otherwise, the request will be denied.
                </div>
                <div class="indent-5 mt-2">
                Therefore, the company seeks a system that can help them adapt to the current era of today.
                Having the Go-Dental, an e-commerce system can make the company more competitive and boost its way of endorsing products. Most of the people in our nation already have a phone and internet access. It will showcase the mobility and flexibility of our current technology in terms of daily browsing and transactions.
